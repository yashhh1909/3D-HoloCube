# 3D-HoloCube
This project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyGame, and OpenGL to create a 3D cube controlled by hand gestures. The thumb-index pinch adjusts zoom, while finger movement rotates the cube. It blends real-time hand tracking with 3D rendering, enabling natural gesture-based interaction for AR/VR and visualization.
